abstract: This paper conducts an empirical analysis of the impact of China’s national and regional Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) on the ﬁnancial performance of listed companies. A comprehensive dataset is constructed, encompassing ﬁrm-level carbon allowance data and ﬁrm-level emission data from July 2021 to December 2022. Our ﬁndings indicate that, in the initial years of China’s ETS implementation, companies participating in the national ETS experienced a statistically signiﬁcant superior performance compared to non-participating ﬁrms due to excess free carbon emission allowances. Results also show that National ETS resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in emissions of regulated companies. Nevertheless, involvement in the regional ETS yielded no discernible e↵ect on the ﬁnancial and environmental performance of regulated entities. The outcomes reveal the existence of a substantial and statistically signiﬁcant ”over-allocation of carbon allowances,” predominantly attributable to increased non-operational income of regulated companies in China’s national ETS.
