abstract: Under the national net-zero emission target, carbon disclosure becomes more significant for investors to evaluate corporate climate risk in formulating investing strategies. This study examines the causal relationship between carbon disclosure behaviour and company fundamentals to determine the impact of carbon disclosure on a company's financial performance. Additionally, we explore the association between company stock market performance, carbon disclosure behaviour and the establishment of China's national/regional emission trading systems (ETS). With artificial intelligence tools such as natural language processing and optical character recognition, we established a database of 4336 Chinese A-share listed companies' emission disclosure information from 2017 to 2022. Evidence shows that carbon disclosure raises companies' return rates, return on equity and Tobin's Q while decreasing stock price volatility. Our results also indicate that the stringent climate policy increases the potential climate risk of companies, e.g., the establishment of the national ETS and dual-carbon policy in China. Empirical results illustrate the positive response of financial markets to carbon disclosures which can offset the uncertainty due to the climate policy. This work shows positive economic incentives for companies to make persistent carbon disclosures.
