Power system fault diagnosis helps to reproduce the fault process and provide the dispatchers with a basis for fault decision-making. The aim of this research theme is to try to adapt quantum approximate optimization algorithm to solve power system fault diagnosis problem under current hardware limit, utilizing the potential advantages of quantum computing to handle more complex power system faults.
