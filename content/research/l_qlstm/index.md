Accurate carbon price forecasting is important for investors and policymakers to make decisions in the carbon market. With the development of quantum computing in recent years, quantum machine learning has shown great potential in a wide range of areas. The aim of this research theme is to try to adapt Quantum Long Short-Term Memory to forecast the carbon price.
