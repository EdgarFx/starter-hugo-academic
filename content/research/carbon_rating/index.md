At present, there is no unified definition of the organizational boundary, scope and management for corporate carbon emission information disclosure in China. China-based Stock Exchanges have no mandatory disclosure requirements for carbon emission information of listed companies either. In the absence of uniform standards, there may be inconsistencies in the statistical methodologies of corporate carbon information disclosure, resulting in the lack of comparability among different emission data. Domestic regulatory authorities need to establish a unified corporate carbon information disclosure standard to supervise the carbon information disclosure of listed companies and assist companies, thus to carry out standardized disclosure. Carbon disclosure is now of great practical significance to the development of enterprises. The leading enterprises in the capital market generally have higher disclosure levels, which will be in turn incentivized by the stock market, thus forming a positive cycle. At the same time, with the national carbon peaking and carbon neutrality policy in place, carbon disclosure, as a social and environmental factor, will continuously be the focus of the capital market. It will also have a greater impact on a company’s stock price, profits and other financial performances. Therefore, it is even more imperative for all companies to improve their own carbon emission management and disclosure systems. While achieving emission reduction targets, they should also reduce the carbon emission intensity and improve the quality of carbon information disclosure. This report proposes a carbon rating system and releases the carbon rating of China’s 100 Overseas Listed Companies.
