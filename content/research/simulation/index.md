title: Simulation Modeling Analysis of Carbon-Electricity Market in the Context of Carbon Neutrality
summary: A hybrid experimental learning method is applied to simulate the carbon-electricity market, which solves the macro-scale problems from the conflict between electricity market price reduction and carbon emission cost, and the micro-scale problems from the different decision time scales.

This paper studied carbon market clearing, electricity market clearing, and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to simulate carbon, electricity, and macro-economy systems. A hybrid experimental learning method is applied to simulate the carbon-electricity market, which solves the macro-scale problems from the conflict between electricity market price reduction and carbon emission cost, and the micro-scale problems from the different decision time scales. Based on the simulation framework, we can study the electricity market forecasting analysis techniques. Based on the Guangdong trial spot market, a case study on a 3-bus electricity market is launched to test the proposed method's adaption in the bidding behavior modeling of the electricity market. Moreover, a CGE experiment finds out that the carbon market can reduce the emission amount of the eight industries. And the carbon price can affect each industry's emission amount, however, it has little effect on the total amount.
