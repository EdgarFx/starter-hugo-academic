I am a senior-year undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), majoring in computer science and engineering. I'm fortunate to join [Energy Internet Lab](https://www.zhaojunhua.org/) and [AIRS](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at CUHKSZ from 2021, supervised by [Prof. Junhua Zhao](https://www.zhaojunhua.org/). Currently, I am a research intern in the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Howie Choset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~choset/).

During my time at Energy Internet Lab and AIRS, my research was focused on **Quantum Science and Engineering**, and **Energy and Sustainability**. In addition, I participated in a research project on **robot navigation** at the [BAIR Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) this spring, under the guidance of [Dr. Chih-Yuan Chiu](https://chihyuanchiu.github.io/) and [Prof. Somil Bansal](https://smlbansal.github.io/). I am now engaged in **confined-space SLAM** and **3D reconstruction** at the Biorobotics Lab.

In addition to academic research, I have an entrepreneurial experience (Shenzhen TeaBreak Network Technology Co., Ltd.), and as the head of the back-end development department, I participated in developing multiple products. **Teabreak Github Link**: https://github.com/TeaBreak-Tech.
