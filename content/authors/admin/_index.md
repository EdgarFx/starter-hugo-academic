Undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Currently at UC Berkeley as a visiting student (23 spring). Looking for a Ph.D. position in 24 Fall.

As an undergraduate student, I hope to broaden my horizons and learn knowledge in various fields so as to find my real interest. Therefore, my previous research areas covered a wide range from economics to computer science and engineering, including:
1. Carbon Market (ESG evaluation system, carbon disclosure and carbon quotas, policy analysis);
2. Power Systems (fault diagnosis, modeling simulation, electricity market);
3. Quantum Computing (quantum machine learning and quantum optimization);
4. Computer Vision (3D reconstruction, SLAM, SfM, table recognition);

Currently I find myself very interested in deep learning and its applications in engineering, such as robotics. I am now focusing on the field of robotics and computer vision, and will participate the Robotics Institute Summer Scholar program (RISS) at Carnegie Mellon University this summer.

In addition to academic research, I have an entrepreneurial experience (Shenzhen TeaBreak Network Technology Co., Ltd.), and as the head of the back-end development department, I participated in the development of multiple products. Github Link: https://github.com/TeaBreak-Tech.
